/**
 * Task dispatcher takes task from clients, and delegates their execution to a configurable number
 * of workers. The task can be processed one at a time or in batches. Only non-expired tasks are
 * executed, and if a newer task with the same id is scheduled for execution, the old one is
 * deleted. Lazy dispatch of work (only on demand) to workers, guarantees that data are always up to
 * date, and no stale task processing takes place.
 *
 * <h3>Task processor</h3>
 *
 * A client of this component must provide an implementation of {@link TaskProcessor} interface,
 * which will do the actual work of task processing. This implementation must be thread safe, as it
 * is called concurrently by multiple threads.
